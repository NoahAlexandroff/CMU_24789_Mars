--labels
RGB key:
0,0,0 - soil
1,1,1 - bedrock
2,2,2 - sand
3,3,3 - big rock
255,255,255 - NULL (no label)
----train
Train contains a cleaned and merged version of crowdsourced labels with a minimum agreement of 3 labelers 
and 2/3 agreement for each pixel. Distances further than 30 meters are masked. The rover itself is also masked.
----test
Test contains a merged version of expert gathered labels with 100% agreement required on each pixel.
3 different versions of the merge are provided which specify how many people has to agree on each pixel
for it to be included in the label. min3 is the sparsest as it requires all 3 labelers to agree.
 

--images
Names of images match names of labels, except for the extension (JPG, png)
----edr, rdr, eff, mrl
The actual images of Mars that training and inference is run on. rdr and mrl refer to radiometrically corrected versions of their edr and eff counterparts.
----mxy
Rover masks used to remove labels/inferences from the rover. Masked regions are set to 1 (binary image).
----rng-30m, rnl-30m
Range masks used to mask out distances that are further than 30 meters. Masked regions are set 
to 1 (binary image). This product is generated from planetary data system (PDS) range image products 
for many Mars images. Future versions of the dataset will include instructions on downloading and processing of those range products.
